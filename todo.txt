need warnings about dropping incomplete cases from fitting data
	this can result in 0 observations for y, and the message:
	"k_folds is 10, but there are only 0 observations. Setting k_folds to 0 (LOOCV)."
need warnings about lack of 1-2 seasons in the fitting data.
	"this will mean no predictions for those seasons"
need a thing for just switching off the seasonal term
	thought this can already be done through custom_formula
documentation about all of this

need to show this so user can decide what gauges to include.
